# aws-cloud-projects-portfolio

A curated collection of 10 hands-on AWS projects that demonstrate my practical knowledge of cloud computing, infrastructure automation, monitoring, cost optimization, and security best practices. Each project focuses on a specific AWS service, built with real-world use cases and documented with deployment steps.
